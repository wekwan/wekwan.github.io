        <h1>McDonald's Data Report</h1>

        <p>Looking at the total sales of chicken fillets, fish fillets, and hamburgers in 2018, we can see that there is a dip in sales in October, the month Burger King came out with the Impossible Burger. While this may not be sole reason that the sales dropped, it can suggest that Burger King’s new addition drew some customers away.</p>

        <p>We can see that across all regions, hamburger sales dropped severely in the month of October, suggesting that customers were drawn to Burger King’s Impossible Burger.</p>

        <p>A similar decrease in sales can be seen in the chicken fillet sales across regions. </p>

        <p>A similar decrease in sales can be seen in the fish fillet sales across regions as well.</p>

        <p>Moving on the macro trends, we see that sales across chicken fillets, fish fillets, and hamburgers have increased steadily from 2016 to 2018. While we don’t have all the data for 2019 yet, it seems sales will not increase this year from 2018. To remedy this stagnating growth, we might want to try to introduce a new item like the Impossible Burger, as health consciousness continues to trend. </p>

        <p>On micro trends, it seems like hamburger and chicken fillet sales peak on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Fish fillet sales seem to peak most on Friday. With this insight, we should increase production of these foods for weekends. </p>

        <p>Looking across hamburger, chicken fillet, and fish fillet sales in a sample month, we can see that sales are relatively stable throughout the month for hamburger and chicken fillets. Fish fillets, however, seem to be much more erratic. We should use this information to better manage our supply and production of fish fillets.</p>
